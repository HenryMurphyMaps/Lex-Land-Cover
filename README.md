# Lexington KY land cover change
## The total percent changed of developed area from 2001-2019 is 4.54%.


the most significant change in the Lexington area would be residential areas being built over the years. Mostly, it seems that the large urban landscape has stayed somewhat unchanged compared to the greater Lexington area outside of the main downtown landscape.
